The description must be a single, continuous phrase, structured as a list of key-visual features separated by commas.
Break down the character's appearance into the following categories and be as specific as possible:

1.  **Overall:** Start with a general description (e.g., "a young woman", "an elderly man", "a cartoon robot").
2.  **Face:** Describe facial features like eye color, face shape, and any notable marks (e.g., "with bright blue eyes, a round face, freckles across her nose").
3.  **Hair:** Detail the hair style, color, and length (e.g., "long, wavy blonde hair tied in a ponytail").
4.  **Clothing:** List specific articles of clothing from top to bottom, including colors and styles (e.g., "wearing a worn-out brown leather jacket over a white t-shirt, dark blue jeans, and black combat boots").
5.  **Accessories:** Mention any distinct accessories (e.g., "wearing silver hoop earrings and a small backpack").

Combine these elements into a single, comma-separated descriptive phrase. DO NOT use any preamble or introductory text like "The character is...".

${styleInstruction}

**Character Consistency is PARAMOUNT:**
You have been provided with "Character Sheets" containing detailed descriptions and/or reference images. Treat these sheets as the absolute source of truth.

**Your Golden Rule:** Every time a character appears in a scene, you MUST use their full, detailed description from the Character Sheet to describe them. This is not optional. This repetition is intentional and crucial for the AI video generator to maintain consistency.

- Refer to characters as "Character 1", "Character 2", etc.
- Always adhere strictly to their provided details. The reference image is the primary source of truth for appearance.

First, write a detailed and engaging story in Vietnamese that follows the provided outline. The story should be structured to match the ${numPrompts} prompts that will be created. ${videoStyle === 'ai-lip-sync' ? 'The story MUST include dialogue for the characters.' : ''}

Second, based on the story you just wrote, create an array of exactly ${numPrompts} video prompts in English. Each prompt must describe a single, continuous 8-second scene and follow the story logically.

**Prompt Structure:** Each prompt MUST be a single, continuous string, structured with specific bracketed sections. Follow this format precisely for every prompt.
\`[STYLE KEYWORDS] - [MAIN CHARACTER 1: Full Description] [SCENE: Description] [LIGHTING: Description] [AUDIO: Description] [TIME/LOCATION: Description]\`

1.  **[STYLE KEYWORDS]:**
    - Start with a list of 5-10 comma-separated keywords that define the visual style and quality. Examples: "hyper-realistic textures, photorealistic rendering, naturalistic lighting, lifelike details, cinematic realism, tactile surfaces".

2.  **[MAIN CHARACTER 1: Full Description]:**
    - For EACH character present in the scene, you must include a dedicated bracketed section. Use "MAIN CHARACTER 1", "MAIN CHARACTER 2", etc., corresponding to their character sheet.
    - The bracket MUST start with \`[MAIN CHARACTER [number]:\`.
    - Inside this bracket, you MUST embed their full, detailed description from the Character Sheet. This repetition is critical for consistency.

3.  **[SCENE: Description]:**
    - Describe the camera shot (e.g., Extreme Wide Shot, Low Angle Shot), the setting, and the character actions. Be highly descriptive and cinematic. Use terms like 'Dolly In', 'Pan Left', etc.
    - Example: "[SCENE: Extreme Wide Shot of a massive, decaying cathedral... The camera slowly Dollies In...]"

4.  **[LIGHTING: Description]:**
    - Detail the lighting of the scene, including sources, mood, and color palette.
    - Example: "[LIGHTING: Dramatic lightning flashes... Cold blue moonlight... The color palette is dominated by deep blues, greys...]"

5.  **[AUDIO: Description]:**
    - Describe all sounds for the scene, including ambient sounds, sound effects, and character dialogue (if applicable).
    - Example: "[AUDIO: Thunder rumbling overhead, rain hammering on the roof... Leo's soft humming...]"
    - ${videoStyle === 'ai-lip-sync' ? 'Include character dialogue directly from the story. Dialogue can be prefixed with "voice:" for clarity.' : 'DO NOT include any narration or background music.'}

6.  **[TIME/LOCATION: Description]:**
    - Specify the time of day and the exact location.
    - Example: "[TIME/LOCATION: Midnight, abandoned cathedral interior - establishing their current home]"

**Example of a final prompt:**
\`hyper-realistic textures, photorealistic rendering, naturalistic lighting, cinematic realism - [MAIN CHARACTER 1: a 12-year-old boy with haunted emerald green eyes, unkempt chestnut brown hair, wearing a faded blue jacket over a grey t-shirt, worn jeans, and sneakers.] [MAIN CHARACTER 2: a majestic but malnourished Irish Wolfhound with intelligent amber eyes and grey and white fur.] [SCENE: Extreme Wide Shot of a massive, decaying cathedral during a thunderstorm. Rain lashes against broken stained glass windows. The camera slowly Dollies In through a hole in the roof, revealing Character 1 huddled with Character 2 in a dry corner.] [LIGHTING: Dramatic lightning flashes illuminate the vast space, casting long, moving shadows. Cold blue moonlight filters through broken windows. The color palette is dominated by deep blues and greys.] [AUDIO: Thunder rumbling, rain hammering on the roof, wind howling. The dog's deep, rhythmic breathing. The boy's soft humming.] [TIME/LOCATION: Midnight, abandoned cathedral interior]\`
